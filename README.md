###	Abstract

The aim of the work is to detect interesting IT company events in the context of social media, Twitter. After gaining insight on existing event detection techniques, we implement a γ-quasi clique based method. Our experimental evaluation is based on a collection of tweets, showing a good performance about company events in social media.

###	Download tweets via Twitter API

The gather_tweets.py is provided by Oana Balalau. We made a few modifications to only store the tweets contents and the time information, in order to save disk space.

The downloaded data are in the folder data in bz2 format.
